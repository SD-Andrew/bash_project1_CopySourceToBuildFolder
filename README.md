Build a Build Script

One common use of bash scripts is for releasing a “build” of your source code. Sometimes your private source code may contain developer resources or private information that you don’t want to release in the published version.

In this project, you’ll create a release script to copy certain files from a source directory into a build directory.

The script gets the version number from the first line of changelog.md.

The script will not copy the file secretinfo.md over from the source folder to the build folder.
